	<p> My name is Ivan. I recently found a passion in coding and web development and currentyly I'm a student at the Coding Bootcap at UT. I live in Austin but originally from El Paso, Texas. I am excited to be part of the tech industry here in Austin, which is a great hub in the tech world.</p>

	<p>When I'm not writing code or typing away, you'll find me at home being a dad to an amazing son and a husband to a beautiful wife.</p>
